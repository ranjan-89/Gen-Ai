**Gen AI**
Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that can create new content like text, images, code, audio, video, and data instead of only analyzing existing data.

**Gen AI development flow**

Data Collection - Gather required data from different sources.
Data Preprocessing - Clean and prepare data for training.
Model Training - Teach the AI model using prepared data.
Model Optimization - Improve model speed and accuracy.
Content Generation - Model creates text, images, or other outputs.
Evaluation - Check model performance and accuracy.

**Gen AI Applications**
Chatbots :- ChatGPT
Image generation :- AI-generated art
Music creation :- OpenAI Jukebox
Code generation :- Copilot
Content creation :- Copy.ai

**Advantages of Gen AI**
Saves time and effort
Improves productivity
Generates creative content
Automates tasks
Scales easily

**Challenges**
Data quality issues - Bad data gives wrong results.
Requires large datasets - Needs a lot of data to work well.
Model accuracy errors - Sometimes gives incorrect outputs.
Bias & Ethics Issues - The model may give unfair or incorrect answers.

**Conclusion** 
Generative AI is a powerful technology that creates content, improves productivity, and automates tasks, but it must be used carefully to avoid bias and errors.
